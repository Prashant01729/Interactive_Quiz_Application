 Interactive Quiz App

This is a front-end web-based quiz application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It displays a series of multiple-choice questions, provides immediate feedback on answers, and calculates the final score.

---

## Overview

The project consists of a responsive UI with a splash loading screen followed by a quiz interface. Questions cover basic web and general knowledge, and are hardcoded into the JavaScript file. Users select one option per question, and the correct/incorrect feedback is provided instantly with a final score shown at the end.
